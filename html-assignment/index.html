            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I was born in Tehran, Iran. As a child I had a carefree life. I was not good at most sports, but in swimming I was unchalengable.<br>  
                My dream was to become an electronic genius.So, after highschool, I continued my studying in Electronic at university.
                <br>In 2002, I recieved my bachlor degree in <em>Electronic Enginearing</em>, and in the same year
                I started my master in <em>Opto-Electronic</em> enginering.<br> During my master I was facinated by quantum mechanics and 
                and I realized the hidden beauty in the famous <em> E=mc<sup>2</sup></em> equation. <br>Inspired by Albert Einstein<sup>'</sup>s lifestyle, I started learning violin. I tried for 3 years
                but I was not much successful in that.
            </p>
            <p> After graduation I becomr hiered by <abbr title="Iranian Oil Pipline and Telecomunication Company">IOPTC</abbr>.<br>
                 I work there for almost 10 years. After marage, My wife motivated me to change my career and to start my own business.<br>
                So, I decided to make a fresh start in a new country. And now, I am studying Interactive Media Design in college, hopping to win in the gambel I have made.
