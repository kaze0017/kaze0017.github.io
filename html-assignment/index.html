            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am studying Interactive Media Design <abbr title="Interactive Nedia Desig">(IMD))</abbr>in Algonquin College. I have a background in Information Technology. As a child, My dream was to become an electronic genius. So, after high school, I continued my studying in electronics at university.
                In 2002, I received my bachelor's degree in <em>Electronics Engineering</em>, and in the same year, I started my master's in <em>Opto-Electronic</em> engineering.
                During that program, I was fascinated by quantum mechanics and I realized the hidden beauty in the famous <em> E=mc<sup>2</sup></em> equation.
                Inspired by Albert Einstein's lifestyle, I started learning the violin. I tried for 3 years but I was not much successful in that.
            </p>
            <p> After graduation, I was hired by Iranian Oil Pipline and Telecomunication Company (<abbr title="Iranian Oil Pipline and Telecomunication Company">IOPTC</abbr>).<br>
                I work there for almost 10 years, first as a field engineer and next IT department administrator. During those years, I gained experience in working with optical devices, cisco switches, HP servers, and virtualization.  After marriage, I decided to change my career and start my own business.
                Registering in college for a fresh start was the first step I made to make it possible.
